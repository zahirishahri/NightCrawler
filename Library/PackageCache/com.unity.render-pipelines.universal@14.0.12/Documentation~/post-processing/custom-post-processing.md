# Custom post-processing

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) provides a variety of pre-built [post-processing effects](../integration-with-post-processing) that you can adjust to create a particular visual effect or style. URP also lets you create custom post-processing effects.

The following pages describe different approaches to creating custom post-processing effects.

| Page | Description |

| [Create a low-code custom post-processing effect](post-processing-custom-effect-low-code.md) | How to use a Full Screen Render Pass to create a low-code custom post-processing effect. |
| [Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature reference](../renderer-features/renderer-feature-full-screen-pass.md) | Understand the Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature. |
